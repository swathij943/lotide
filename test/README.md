# Lotide

The Lotide project is inspired by the Lodash project, which is a utility library for JavaScript. While Lodash itself is quite powerful, our version of it is simpler in order to focus on learning the fundamentals of programming and data management using JavaScript.

The Lotide project is a modular collection of functions that operate on data, namely Arrays and Objects. In creating these functions, we will become more comfortable with FOCAL as well as writing modular code and Automated Testing (by writing unit tests). At first, we create our own assertion functions for writing test code, but by the end of the project we use industry-standard libraries Mocha and Chai for our automated testing. Through Lotide, we also learn about software dependencies, package management, and npm, the package manager of choice in the Node community. We learn that anyone can publish their own npm package by publishing Lotide.

## Purpose

This project was published and created for my learning.
